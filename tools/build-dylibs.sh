# **Standalone means no CydiaSubstrate, and that is proved here rather than claimed.** A dylib
# that still links Substrate loads on a jailbroken phone and does nothing at all on a sideloaded
# one, where the failure is silent: the app simply looks untweaked. The same three checks CI runs
# are run here, because the whole point of building locally is to find that out on this machine.
#
#   1. no Substrate in the *dependencies* -- `otool -L` prints the file's own name and then its
#      install name before them, and every tweak here installs under /Library/MobileSubstrate,
#      so two lines are skipped or the file matches itself and a clean build reads as linked;
#   2. no undefined MS* symbols -- a library can be dropped from the load commands while a symbol
#      it needs remains, which fails at load time instead of here;
#   3. the licence is compiled in -- a self-contained build used to answer the gate with an
#      unconditional yes, so a dylib without SCILicenseAllowsProduct is one that runs unlicensed,
#      which is the single failure nobody would ever report.
