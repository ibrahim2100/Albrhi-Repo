"""Pre-build checks for every tweak in this repository.

Every rule here exists because that exact mistake reached CI at least once.

The rules themselves are written against one tweak, using paths relative to its
own directory -- 'src/**', 'control'. When run from the repository root this
file re-executes itself once per directory under tweaks/, with the working
directory moved there. That keeps eight rules that were each tightened against a

# 1. Duplicate @interface definitions.

# Across every file, not just within each header. Checking headers alone let a
# feature redeclare IGCoreTextView in its own .xm while InstagramHeaders.h already
# had it, which is the same "duplicate interface" build failure the rule exists to
# prevent — it was simply looking in half the places.
#
# The colon in the pattern keeps class extensions @interface Foo () and categories
# @interface Foo (Bar) out of it; only real declarations count.
#
# **Two declarations are only a build failure when the compiler sees both at once.**
# Reporting every cross-file pair cried wolf twelve times on the first tweak that
# declares the same private Apple class in two providers that never share a
# translation unit -- NUMusicProvider.m imports neither NUPrivate.h nor the header
# that does, so clang never sees the pair and upstream builds clean. The rule now
# resolves each compiled unit's transitive quoted-import closure and reports a class
# only when one closure holds two of its declarations, which is exactly when clang
# would say "duplicate interface definition". The original Instagram bug it was
# written for -- a feature redeclaring IGCoreTextView while importing
# InstagramHeaders.h, which does too -- is still caught, because there both land in
# that .xm's own closure.

# 2. Brace balance and %hook/%end pairing.
#
#    %group and %subclass close with %end too, and counting only %hook made the rule
#    report a broken file the moment the first group was written -- a false alarm, on
#    correct code, from a rule that had simply never seen valid syntax the project had
#    not used yet. Every opener is counted now.
#
#    The pairing still means something: an %end without an opener, or an opener left
#    unclosed, is the failure this catches, and both still fail.
#
#    **Braces inside literals had to stop counting, and a character literal is what proved it.**
#    A byte sniffer testing `b[0] == '{'` for a JSON payload is ordinary, correct C -- and it made
#    this rule report a structurally broken file, on code that compiled, because the counter read
#    every `{` in the file including the one inside quotes. Comments and string literals carry the
#    same hazard (a `}` in a comment, a brace in a format string), so all three are removed before
#    counting rather than only the case that happened to be found.
#    **And this needs a scanner, not four regular expressions, for the reason rule 5 already
#    knew.** The first attempt stripped block comments, then line comments, then literals -- and
#    `@"https://..."` inside a dictionary literal lost everything after the `//`, including the
#    closing brace on that line, so removing false positives created two. A `//` inside a string
#    and a quote inside a comment are the same problem from opposite sides, and only one pass that
#    knows which state it is in can be right about both.

# 3. Hooked classes that touch self but have no @interface.
#
# Logos leaves a `%hook` on an undeclared class with only a forward declaration, and a
# `self` typed as a forward-declared class cannot be sent *any* message -- not even
# `-respondsToSelector:`, which is where the X inline button's build actually failed, on
# the guard rather than the property. So this catches a message send to self as well as
# `self.<property>`; the first version saw only the dot syntax and missed the button.
#
# @interface declarations are read from the sources too, not only the headers: the fix for
# that same failure declared the class inline in the .x, and a rule that looked only in
# headers would then have called the fixed file broken -- a false alarm on correct code,
# which is the way a check earns being ignored.
#
# System classes are skipped: a hooked NSFileManager or UIWindow gets its @interface from
# the SDK import, so `self` is fully typed and the send compiles. They are recognised by
# the Apple two-letter framework prefixes, none of which collide with this project's own
# (SCI, IG, T1/TFS/TFN/TAE/TAV/TPS/TUC/TUI, ML, YT).

# 23. `-valueForKey:` on somebody else's object.
#
#     **The single most expensive habit in this repository's history**, and until now the
#     only defence against it was a paragraph in CLAUDE.md that nobody greps before writing
#     a hook. It is not a probe: it calls the real getter when one exists and reads the
#     ivar directly when one does not, so it *runs the app's own code* -- and raising is
#     its last resort, not its first. The follow-badge feature probed twelve guessed keys
#     with it, on every object up the responder chain, from inside `-layoutSubviews`, and
#     changing a profile picture crashed Instagram.
#
#     `@try` does not redeem it. `@catch` catches `NSException`; a Swift getter that traps,
#     a failed assertion or a half-initialised object are none of those and end the process
#     with no handler ever running. The comment asserting otherwise survived several
#     releases precisely because the crash it caused looked unrelated.
#
#     `shared/src/SCIKVC.h` is the replacement: `SCISafeValueForKey`, `SCISafeBoolForKey`
#     and `SCISafeNumberForKey` resolve a key the same four ways KVC does -- `-key`,
#     `-isKey`, `-getKey`, then the ivar -- but every getter is checked with
#     `-respondsToSelector:` and read through a cast taken from its own type encoding, and
#     the ivar is only read when the runtime says it holds an object.
#

#     NSDictionary is a documented, safe operation on a class this project does not hook.
