# Everything a preference bundle in this repository shares.

# Separate from shared/tweak.mk on purpose. That file exists to build a
# MobileSubstrate dylib: it forces JGProgressHUD in, sets Logos flags, and ends
# with tweak.mk. A preference bundle is a different product -- bundle.mk, no
# filter plist, no injection, and it links against Preferences rather than into
# somebody else's app.
#
# Teaching tweak.mk to be both would mean editing the one file both shipping
# tweaks depend on, to serve a third that does not resemble them. The rule this
# project already follows for check.py applies here too: leave the expensive
# thing alone and add beside it.

# A preference bundle names its own sources with a `find` over its `src/`, so nothing
# under shared/ arrives on its own -- and the panel reads filter plists' contents off
# objects it does not own, which is exactly what SCIKVC exists for.
# The preference-bundle kit: the header view, the app cell, the badge art and the button
# action, shared by every bundle here.
#
# They lived inside Albrhi Panel until NextUp and Watch were separated out of it. Each of
# those now ships a Settings row of its own rather than a page inside Albrhi's, and all
# three draw the same furniture -- so it moved here rather than being copied twice. Each
# bundle still supplies its own `SCILocalized`, which is why the kit declares that in
# SCILocalizeAPI.h instead of importing a table by a relative path.
