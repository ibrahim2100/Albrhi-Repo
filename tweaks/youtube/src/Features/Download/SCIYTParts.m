/// Four, and the number is a compromise rather than a maximum. Google serves these happily
/// enough in parallel, but a phone on a weak connection sharing its bandwidth four ways makes
/// each individual part slower and likelier to time out -- and a timeout costs a retry, which
/// costs more than the parallelism saved.
//
// **Four was a tested constant, and it is now a floor rather than the answer.**
//
// An HLS playlist is a few hundred segments, so this number is the largest single lever on how
// long a download takes -- and the right value is a property of somebody's network, not of this
// source. Google's servers may throttle a client that opens too many connections, which is not
// measurable from a build machine, so it is asked rather than decided: the settings row offers
// 4, 6 and 8, and an unset preference keeps exactly the behaviour that has been shipping.
