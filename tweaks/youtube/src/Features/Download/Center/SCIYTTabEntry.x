/// The way into the Download Centre, as one of YouTube's own tabs.
///
/// The first version of this drew a red circle over the tab bar. It worked and it looked
/// exactly like what it was: a button sitting on top of the bar rather than in it, with no
/// label, no selected state, no indicator dot, and no share of the width when the bar
/// re-laid itself out.
///
/// This does not draw anything. YouTube's tab bar is built from a protobuf -- a
/// YTIPivotBarRenderer holding one YTIPivotBarItemRenderer per tab -- and the bar is handed
/// that renderer through -setRenderer:. One more item is appended on the way through, and
/// YouTube then builds the tab itself: its own item view, its own label font, its own
/// selection behaviour, its own spacing. There is nothing to keep in sync because there is
/// nothing of ours being drawn.
///
/// **The fields are set with KVC, deliberately.** These are GPBMessage subclasses and their
/// fields are resolved dynamically, so -respondsToSelector: answers NO for a field that
/// -setValue:forKey: sets perfectly well. That is recorded in CLAUDE.md and it is the whole
/// reason this reads as key paths rather than as method calls.
///
/// **The icon is not set through the renderer.** A YTIIcon wants an iconType, which is an
/// enum whose names are not in the binary in any form that can be read -- so choosing a
/// value would be guessing at what draws, which is the one thing this project does not do.
/// The item view's own image view is given our symbol after YouTube has built it. If that
/// fails the tab is a label with no icon, which is a smaller loss than a wrong picture.
///
/// The failure is soft at every step. If the pivot bar classes are not there, or the append
/// throws, no tab appears and the old floating button is left in place instead -- so the
/// entrance never disappears entirely.
