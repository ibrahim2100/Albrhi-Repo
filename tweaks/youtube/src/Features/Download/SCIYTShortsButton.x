/// A save button in Shorts, in the column with like, comment and share.

/// reached by a gesture nobody knows about is a feature nobody uses. Shorts has no long
/// press to spare -- the whole surface is already a scrubber and a swipe -- so it gets a
/// button instead.
///
/// **The hook is -layoutActionBar, and nothing about where the button goes is written down
/// as a number.** The action bar is found by measuring the overlay's own subviews: the
/// narrow column standing against the trailing edge is the one, and our button is placed
/// just above it. A hard-coded offset works on the phone it was tuned on and is wrong on
/// every other size, and this project has no second phone to check against.
///
/// What was found goes into the diagnostics report either way, so "no button in Shorts" is
/// answerable without another release to find out.
