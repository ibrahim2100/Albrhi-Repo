/// **The video ID is never sent.** SponsorBlock offers two endpoints: one takes the
/// video ID, the other takes the first four characters of its SHA-256 and returns the
/// segments of every video whose hash starts the same way. The first is simpler and
/// tells a third party exactly what you are watching, every time you watch something.
/// For a tweak whose Instagram half exists to stop an app reporting what you look at,
/// that was not a real choice.
///
/// The cost is honest and paid locally: the hashed endpoint returns the raw submissions
/// rather than the server's curated pick, so the filtering by votes and action type that
/// the server would have done happens here instead.
