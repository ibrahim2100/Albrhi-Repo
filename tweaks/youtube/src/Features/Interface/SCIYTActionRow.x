/// row is `YTSlimVideoScrollableDetailsActionsView` and it is handed its buttons through
/// `-createActionViewsFromSupportedRenderers:` (`v24@0:8@16`); one more entry in that array and
/// YouTube builds the button itself — its own metrics, its own label font, its own collapse
/// behaviour when the row runs out of width, its own scrolling. There is nothing of ours being
/// drawn and so nothing to keep in sync, which is the same reason the Download Centre tab is a
/// pivot renderer rather than a circle painted over the tab bar.
///
/// **Every hop of the chain was read from the app's own class metadata, not guessed:**
///
///   YTISlimMetadataButtonSupportedRenderers . slimMetadataButtonRenderer : YTISlimMetadataButtonRenderer
///   YTISlimMetadataButtonRenderer           . button                     : YTIButtonSupportedRenderers
///   YTIButtonSupportedRenderers             . buttonRenderer             : YTIButtonRenderer
///   YTIButtonRenderer                       . text : YTIFormattedString, targetId : NSString, icon : YTIIcon
///
/// Each class names the next in its declared property *type*, which is what `tools/objc-classes.py`
/// prints and the only kind of chain that has ever worked in this project.
///
/// **`targetId` is why this needs no title matching.** It is a plain string the renderer carries,
/// so the button is recognised at tap time by a value this file wrote — not by comparing an
/// accessibility label against an English word, which is a test that fails on the owner's own
/// Arabic phone.
///
/// **The icon is painted on afterwards, deliberately.** `YTIIcon` wants an `iconType`, an enum
/// whose values are not readable from the binary in any form — so choosing one is guessing at
/// what draws. The Download Centre tab already made that refusal and this makes the same one: the
/// button YouTube built is given our symbol once it exists, and a build where that fails shows a
/// labelled button with no picture rather than the wrong picture.
///
/// **Not on the launch path.** This row is built when a video is opened, which is why the feature
/// can be on by default at all: the tab-bar work next door had to be moved off the launch and this
