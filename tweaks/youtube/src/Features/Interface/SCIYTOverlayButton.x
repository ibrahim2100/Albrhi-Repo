/// A save button inside YouTube's own player, and the clock time the video ends at.
///
/// Until now the tweak had no presence on the layer over the video at all: a tab at the
/// bottom of the app and buttons in Shorts, and nothing where a video is actually being
/// watched. Saving meant leaving the player, which is the one moment nobody wants to.
///
/// **The technique is read from YTVideoOverlay by PoomSmart (MIT), not copied from it.**
/// That tweak is a framework other tweaks register buttons with; this is one button for one
/// tweak, so the registry, the settings integration and the per-tweak metadata table it
/// carries are all left out. What is taken is the answer to the only question that mattered:
/// *which two classes own the two places a button can go*, which is exactly the kind of
/// thing this project reads open source for rather than guessing at.
///
/// **Both classes are leads.** Neither appears in a class dump this project has taken of
/// this build, so nothing here assumes either exists:
///
///   - a `%hook` on an absent class never attaches, which is the cheap half;
///   - every selector is behind `-respondsToSelector:`, because a class that exists with a
///     renamed accessor is the case that crashes rather than no-ops;
///   - the diagnostics report names which of the two attached, so "no button" is never two
///     silent reasons at once. That loop is what this project uses instead of guessing, and
///     it is the whole reason the X tweak's three button surfaces are all still in place.
///
/// The end time is a label rather than a fourth thing drawn on the progress bar. The bar is
/// two points of usable height -- the SponsorBlock markers sit *on* it at that thickness --
/// and a time needs a line of text, so it goes in the container beside the icons where
/// there is room for one.
///

///
/// What this surface is actually doing, in numbers rather than in one overwritten sentence.
///
/// **This button shipped with no report at all for eight releases.** Its only record went into
/// `-recordMarkerBar:`, which is the SponsorBlock progress-bar line — so a feature that was off
/// by default and unconfirmed had its one piece of evidence filed under an unrelated heading,
/// and no report has ever mentioned it. A diagnostic written into the wrong slot is worse than

// buttons beside it, so a measurement of the row's height has nothing left to decide.


/// **Placement happens once per overlay, and never from inside a layout pass.**
///
/// `-topControls` is a getter YouTube calls *while it is laying out*, and 1.27.1 put
/// `-bringSubviewToFront:` in it, plus two localized format strings and a diagnostics write, on
/// every single call. Bringing a subview to the front marks the hierarchy as needing layout;
/// laying out asks for `-topControls` again; and that is a loop with nothing to stop it. On top
/// of it 1.28.2 set a constraint constant from `-layoutSubviews`, measured with
/// `-topControlsHeight` — the height of the row this button is inside — so the measurement moved
/// every time the button did. Two feedback loops on the main thread, in the player, which is why
/// YouTube sat on its own logo and never finished launching.
///
/// The rule this leaves behind is worth more than the fix: **a hook on a getter that layout calls
/// must be free the second time.** Do the work when there is work — build the button once, place
/// it once — and hand back `%orig` untouched ever after.
// The write cap is gone with the constraint it protected. It bounded how many times a constraint
// constant could be written, because a measurement that would not settle was a loop; a frame
// written onto a child cannot loop, and this frame legitimately changes on every rotation,
// fullscreen toggle and reflow. What stops needless writes is the half-point comparison below.

// attribute inside @encode, which clang reports as ignored-while-parsing-a-type and
// -Werror turns into three fatal errors in one generated line. Every other %new in this
// project writes a plain typed parameter for the same reason; an unused one is not warned
// about in an Objective-C method the way it would be in a C function.
//
// **The frame is written from -layoutSubviews, and the difference from what broke the app is
// exactly what is written.**
//
// Applying it only on the two visibility signals left the button drifting: the overlay lays its
// own controls out whenever the player resizes, rotates, enters fullscreen or simply reflows, and
// a frame measured from where the neighbours *were* is wrong the moment they move. The button
// looked placed and then wandered.
//
// What made 1.28.2 unlaunchable was not writing from layout — it was writing a **constraint
// constant** measured from the row this button is inside: that invalidates the constraint system
// upward, the parent lays out again, and the measurement moves again. Setting a *child's frame*
// marks the child as needing layout and does not ask the parent for anything, so it settles in
// one pass. With the half-point guard below, an unchanged frame is not written at all.
