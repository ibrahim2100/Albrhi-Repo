# The lyrics module, compiled for the Mac and actually run.
#
# **Why this exists.** CLAUDE.md says compilation is the second of three gates and the third is a
# device -- true of every hook, and not true of everything. An LRC parser, a title normaliser and a
# romaniser are pure functions of their input: they can be proved here, in seconds, with no phone in
# the room. Three of this project's most expensive bugs lived in exactly that layer.
#
# The arrangement is YTMEnhanced's (GPLv3): build the pure sources against the macOS SDK's
# iOSSupport frameworks as a Catalyst binary. What is ours is the source list -- only the modules
# this package actually carries -- and the absence of a resource bundle, which upstream's own
# YTMULocalized() already handles by falling back to the inline English.
