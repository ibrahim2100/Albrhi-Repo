# Albrhi for TikTok — what changed

## v0.1.0

Scaffold only. The tweak's structure exists — Makefile, control, filter plist, source
layout, bilingual localisation table, the panel gate — so `tools/check.py` and
`./build.sh tiktok rootless` both run against it while the real hooks are written. No
feature patches TikTok yet.

Two references were read for architecture, both by the same author family already
credited in the X tweak's own control file: BandarHL's original BHTikTok
(github.com/BandarHL/BHTikTok) and al3raQe's maintained fork
(github.com/al3raQe/BHTikTok). Neither carries a LICENSE file, so both are read the same
cautious way every other unlicensed reference in this project is — for *where* things are
hookable, never for the code itself. Their `Tweak.x` hooks 34 classes; the ones that
matter for what this project would actually build:

- **Ads**: `AWEAPMManager`, `TTAdSplashDeviceHelper`
- **Download / feed model**: `AWEAwemeModel`, `AWEURLModel`, `AWEPlayVideoPlayerController`,
  `AWEFeedVideoButton`, `AWEFeedViewTemplateCell`, `AWEAwemeDetailTableViewCell`
- **Profile**: `TIKTOKProfileHeaderView`, `AWEProfileImagePreviewView`,
  `AWEProfileEditTextViewController`, `AWEUserModel`
- **Confirmations / comments**: `AWECommentPanelCell`, `AWEPlayInteractionUserAvatarElement`
- **Device / jailbreak-detection evasion**: `BDADeviceHelper`, `BDInstallNetworkUtility`,
  `GULAppEnvironmentUtil`, `UIDevice`, `CTCarrier`, `NSFileManager` — the same class of
  check Locket's own bypass answers, not a paywall
- **Settings surface**: `TTKSettingsBaseCellPlugin`, `AWESettingsNormalSectionViewModel`,
  `SparkViewController` (built on Cephei/CepheiPrefs, an external dependency this project
  does not use — a native settings screen would be written instead, the way every other
  tweak here already does it)

**Deliberately not being built, regardless of what a class dump confirms**:
`PIPOIAPStoreManager` and `PIPOStoreKitHelper` — an in-app-purchase / StoreKit fake, the
same shape of thing `Check0verPlus.dylib` was for Locket and was reviewed and refused for
the same reason: that takes money from TikTok's own developers, it is not a device tweak.
Any "fake verified badge" / "fake follower count" cosmetic-spoofing features named in
BHTikTok's own README are being treated the same way as Locket's Check0verPlus review
until there is a reason to think otherwise — parked, not assumed safe.

Next: a real class dump and a real IPA of the current TikTok build, so every hook is
confirmed against what actually exists on this build rather than carried over from a
reference that may target a TikTok years older than today's.
