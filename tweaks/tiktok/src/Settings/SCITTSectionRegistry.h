//  The settings screen, composed from files that register themselves.
//
//  **Why this shape.** `SCITTStatus.m` held every row of every section in one 220-line array
//  literal inside one method: adding a feature meant editing the middle of a list, deleting one
//  meant counting braces, and reading it meant scrolling past six sections to reach the seventh.
//  The Instagram tweak solved this once already — `SCISettingsRegistry`, one file per page, no
//  shared file to edit — and this is the same idea at section granularity.
//
//  A section appears because its file registered it. Delete the file and the section is gone, with
//  nothing else to change; add one and it slots in at its own order. **No parallel list decides
//  what exists**, which is the failure this project met three times in one week — a title array, a
//  destination array and a row count that drifted apart.

// These were file-local `static`s inside SCITTStatus.m, which is exactly why a section could not

// SCITTReport.m keeps its own copies for its own table and is left alone -- one move at a time.
