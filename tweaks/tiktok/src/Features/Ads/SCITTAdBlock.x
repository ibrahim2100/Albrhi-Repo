/// One gate, at the model's own construction, rather than a view hidden after the fact.
///
/// `-isAds` is the server's own mark for a promoted item — read from `AWEAwemeModel`
/// itself, confirmed present in TikTok 46.4.0's own binary rather than guessed. Refusing
/// the object at `-init`/`-initWithDictionary:error:` means an ad is never built into a
/// feed cell in the first place, which is sturdier than hiding a cell afterwards: nothing
/// downstream that reads the feed array ever sees a gap where an ad used to be, because
/// there was never anything there.
///
/// `%orig` still runs first in both hooks. Refusing the object *after* construction,
/// not by skipping construction, is deliberate: `-isAds` cannot be read before the
/// model has actually decoded the dictionary that sets it.
///
/// `isAd`/`isAdItem`/`isAdsOrPseudoAds` are checked the same way, each guarded by its
/// own `-respondsToSelector:` — see TikTokHeaders.h for why those three are held to a
/// lower confirmation bar than `isAds` itself, and why any one of the four is enough
/// to drop the model rather than requiring all four to exist.
///
/// A kept, non-ad model is handed to SCITTMedia so its download URL can be resolved
/// while the model is still alive -- the only point in this whole pipeline that ever
/// sees the real object.
