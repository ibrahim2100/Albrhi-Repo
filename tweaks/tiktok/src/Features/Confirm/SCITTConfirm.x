/// **Every hook point here was confirmed against the real TikTok 46.4.0 framework, with its type
/// encoding read rather than assumed** -- `tools/objc-classes.py` now prints encodings beside
/// selectors for exactly this, after a hook declared from a selector's *name* crashed the app
/// repeatedly (a `^q` out-parameter written as an `NSInteger`, a `void` return written as `id`):
///
///   TTKFeedInteractionLikeManager   -onLikeButtonClicked          v16@0:8
///   TTKFeedInteractionLikeManager   -doubleTapLikeWithAnimation:   v24@0:8@16
///   AWEPlayInteractionUserAvatarElement  -onFollowViewClicked:     v24@0:8@16
///   AWEIMProfileRelationView        -p_didTapFollowButton          v16@0:8
///
/// Both reference tweaks hook the same four, which is as much corroboration as this project ever
/// gets -- but the encodings are ours, from our build, because a working tweak's selector list is
/// what worked for its author.
///
/// **The one design decision worth reading: `%orig` is never captured in a block.** A confirmation
/// is asynchronous -- the answer arrives after the method has already returned -- so the obvious
/// shape is to call `%orig` from the alert's handler, and `%orig` inside a block is exactly the
/// fragile Logos construct this project's own toolchain notes warn about. Instead the action is
/// *replayed*: a flag is raised, the same selector is sent to the same object, and the hook lets it
/// through untouched. That also makes nesting safe by construction -- if TikTok's double-tap path
/// calls the button path internally, the inner call sees the flag and asks nothing.
