    // added stay added, and nothing owns the answer to "is there a button here".

    // — cells, and nothing else. On `AWEAwemeBaseViewController` it has only
    // `na9UniversalDownloadTapped`: a *tap handler*. So the reference places from exactly one kind

    // The base is the placer here rather than the cell, because it is the only one that reaches
    // direct messages and search. The cell and rail surfaces are therefore not installed when it
    // exists — not installed, which is a different thing from standing down.
    // **Not installed. The base surface crashed TikTok three times and it is switched off.**
    //
    // Everything above about ownership and about the inheritance chain is correct and worth
    // keeping — the feed, direct messages and photo albums really are three subclasses of one
    // base, and one owner really is why the references are stable. What is *not* established is
    // that placing a button from inside `-setModel:` on that base is safe on this build, and
    // three attempts each found a new way for it not to be: a hooked method the class does not
    // declare, a model class that is not `AWEAwemeModel` on every subclass, and an unbounded
    // sweep over a hierarchy TikTok owns.
    //
    // **A missing button in direct messages is a smaller cost than an app that dies**, and that
    // is this project's own rule, written down when a crash was traded for SD quality. The cell
