/// feed cell's button reaches its model through `AWEFeedCellViewController.model`, which is an
/// object the app has finished with and is currently showing, and only that path may ask the
/// deeper questions: the bitrate ladder, and anything else that means touching the model's

/// than one that follows a swipe. The paging view controller is what actually knows --
/// `AWEPlayPhotoAlbumViewController -currentIndex` (`Q16@0:8`), reached from the feed cell
