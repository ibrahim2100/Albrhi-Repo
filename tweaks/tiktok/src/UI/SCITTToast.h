/// A banner at the top of the screen that never takes a touch.
///
/// It replaces the centred progress HUD, for three reasons the owner named in one sentence: it
/// sat in the middle of the video, it swallowed scrolling, and it looked like a system alert
/// rather than part of this tweak.
///
/// **Nothing here is modal.** The banner and every view inside it have `userInteractionEnabled`
/// off, so a download in progress cannot stop a scroll — a progress indicator is a *report*, and
/// a report that blocks the app is charging the user for information they did not ask to wait
/// for.
